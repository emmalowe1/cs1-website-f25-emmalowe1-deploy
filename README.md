I did an adventure game. You start in a field and have to decide whether to go into this mysterious cave or the ominous forest. If you go into the cave you see that you need a key to unlock the treasure. You go back to the field then to the forest where the key is. You have to grab the key to go unlock the hidden door and win the game.
